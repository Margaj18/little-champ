Rules:
1. Make sure code is consistant, Modular and scalable
2. Always write test cases first for every requirement and update test cases for every changes asked.Check all the test cases and be asured all the functionality is working as expected.
3. Don't start writing code directly. First analyze the requirement, think all the edge cases, confirm with me if you have any doubts. Once everything is confirmed, start writting code.
